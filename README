# Metro Game Cab
Metro Game Cab is a simplified front-end for emulators based on Cabrio, a emulator front-end that is no longer actively developed. This emulator is a front-end primarily designed for use with arcade
cabinets. It features a simple graphical interface which is easy to use
with limited controls (e.g. a joystick).

Installation

You will need the following libraries and their headers/development packages:
  * SDL2
  * SDL2_image
  * SDL2_gfx
  * SDL2_mixer
  * SDL2_ttf
  * glut
  * libxml2

Compile the program by running 'make' in this directory. Install by running
'make install' (this will usually have to be done as root, but the location
can be edited in the Makefile).
